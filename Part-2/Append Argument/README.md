For given function type Fn, and any type A (any in this context means we don't restrict the type, and I don't have in mind any type ğŸ˜‰) create a generic type which will take Fn as the first argument, A as the second, and will produce function type G which will be the same as Fn but with appended argument A as a last one.

For example,

```ts
type Fn = (a: number, b: string) => number

type Result = AppendArgument<Fn, boolean> 
// expected be (a: number, b: string, x: boolean) => number
